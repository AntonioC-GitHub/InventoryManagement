# InventoryManagement
This was my final project for my c++ class that took inventory that was documented on a file and turned that information into a histogram, exported inventory details to another file and let users search by specific items.
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- This project took inventory of sales from a store and compiled the sales numbers into a histogram, a outputted document and let the user search for specific items in the intial file that was provided to me. 
What did you do particularly well?
- I think my code works well with no issue. At first I did it without a class function but then when reading the directions, I noticed a class was required so I had to restart the project from scratch to implment the class function. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- I have been really into looking at code with UI and clickable things that users can click such as buttons or certain things that are done on the frontend and I think once I am able to do more UI things with my code that I can improve and make my code look more user friendly instead of just running the code through the command prompt windows. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I struggled with implmenting the class function since I have not had enough practice with it but by reviewing my textbook I was able to follow how they did a class function in an example along with my previous project that involved a class function and got it to work after awhile. I think textbooks, and sites such as StackOverflow could help me better in the longrun
- because someone could have come across a similar bug or issue with code that I have and they could have a soultion that I would never have thought of. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- I think just being familiar with C++ in general will help me in the longrun because the more languages I am familar with the better chances I have at getting a job in the future. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- The code imports a file that is specific to the one assigned in the class. My code could easily change the file being imported to a different file with a few simple clicks so this way the "store" could refer to this code in the future if they ever need to. Also by adding input validation as I have, it makes the code maintainable simply by checking the users input.
